    <p>Family means everything to me. They are my greatest source of love, strength, and unwavering support. No matter the challenges I face, my family is always there, cheering me on in my successes and helping me get through tough times. I truly believe that I wouldn’t be where I am today without their constant encouragement and love.</p>
  <p>As I near the end of my diploma, I’m already looking ahead to pursuing a degree. Some people might see a diploma as a small thing, but for me and my family, it’s a huge achievement. Being the first in my family to go to university, this diploma is so much more than just a piece of paper, it means everything to us. My family didn’t really know much about how university works, but they’ve supported me through it all. It hasn't been easy, but their love and encouragement have kept me going, and I’m truly grateful for that.</p>

No one can cook like she does, and honestly, my diet plans are always failed because her food is just too delicious to resist.Hope you stay healthy forever so I can eat your food till my last breath. I love you to the moon and back, Mama. You're the best!</p>
