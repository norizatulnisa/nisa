                From preschool to Standard 6, I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Ria. I was born and raised by my grandparents in Taman Ria. It’s where I learned the foundational skills that shaped who I am today. I was always in the top class, but when UPSR came, I only managed to get 2As and 4Bs. This taught me that it's not just about grades but also about the journey and lessons learned.

               For my secondary school, I attended Sekolah Menengah Agama Nahdzah in Bukit Besar, Yan, Kedah, where I studied from Form 1 to Form 5. This meant I spent five years in a boarding school. My chosen stream was Dini Tulen, which included the compulsory SPM subjects along with four additional papers in full Arabic.

My abah sent me to this school because he saw my potential for learning Arabic, especially after I scored 8As in UPKK. It was truly an honor to study Arabic for five years. I learned how to write essays, speak fluently, and delve deeply into religious studies. I also memorized surahs like Yassin, Al-Mulk, As-Sajdah, Al-Insan, and many others.

Those years were filled with learning and growth, and I cherish those memories deeply. I miss school so much &#128151;

            <p> For university, I was accepted into UiTM Merbok to pursue my diploma, and I’m currently in my final semester. Throughout my time here, I’ve learned so much while studying Information Management. Although this course wasn’t my top choice, it was actually my sixth. I’ve grown to love it more than I ever expected.

Even though I’m still a bit unsure about what the future holds for me, I’ve embraced the journey. Live, laugh, love Information Management! </p>
